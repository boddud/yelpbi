Welcome - This is Cerebrate Inc's proprietary coding challenge. Re-use of this project for any commercial / non-commercial purposes requires explicit written consent from Cerebrate Inc.

This application is a analytical system which simulates Yelp API & builds visualizations on top of Yelp.

YELP API SIMULATION
-------------------
Yelp API can be simulated by making a request to /yelp_data.json

Restaurant Names & Number of Reviews
------------------------------------
You can get review counts and restaurant names by calling
/call.json

Instructions for getting the application on board!

The application is a Rails 3 application which would require rvm >= 1.9.
The application has d3.v2.js( the d3 version2 liabrary preloaded in the javascripts.)

For running the application,
Extract the application folder,
Set up environment for rails,

In the terminal,

> rvm use 1.9.3
> cd YelpBi
> bundle install
> rails s

This would fire up the application on port 3000,
Please open your browser and in the address bar enter address 'http://localhost:3000'

And you should see a bar graph showing restaurent reviews comparison when the data is loaded from api.
We could also use caching and other methods for faster fetching but currently it is not in the context of application.
 ****** If the application fails to load the data that indeed would mean that the api calls have reached a maximum limit for the day.
