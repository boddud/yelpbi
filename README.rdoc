Welcome!

The application is basically a small analytical system where we show the comparison between reviews of Indian Restaurents in US.
It displays a bar graph to compare between reviews of multiple restaurents.
The reviews are shown on y-axis and the respective restaurent names on x-axis.
The application uses d3.js(version 2 liabrary) for front end bar graph display which is a data-driven-document liabrary and has rails in the backend
for api data manipulation purpose.

Instructions for getting the application on board!

The application is a Rails 3 application which would require rvm >= 1.9.
The application has d3.v2.js( the d3 version2 liabrary preloaded in the javascripts.)

For running the application,
Extract the application folder,
Set up environment for rails,

In the terminal,

> rvm use 1.9.3
> cd Testapp
> bundle install
> rails s


This would fire up the application on port 3000,
Please open your browser and in the address bar enter address 'http://localhost:3000'

And you should see a bar graph showing restaurent reviews comparison when the data is loaded from api.
We could also use caching and other methods for faster fetching but currently it is not in the context of application.
 ****** If the application fails to load the data that indeed would mean that the api calls have reached a maximum limit for the day.
